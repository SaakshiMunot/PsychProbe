-Depression is a common and serious mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed. It affects how a person thinks, feels, and handles daily activities, often leading to significant impairment in various areas of life. 
-Depression is a complex and multifaceted condition that can vary in severity and duration. It can result from a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Effective treatment typically involves a combination of therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or medication (e.g., antidepressants), as well as lifestyle changes and social support. Early intervention and support are essential for managing depression and improving overall well-being.
-Women are more likely than men to experience depression. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), globally, women are about twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with depression. In the United States, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) reports that approximately 8.7% of women experience a major depressive episode in any given year, compared to 5.3% of men.
-Depression can have adverse effects on women's physical health, increasing the risk of chronic health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders. Women with depression may also be more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors like smoking, substance abuse, and poor dietary habits, further exacerbating health risks.
-There are specific types of depression that are unique to women:
    -Premenstrual dysphoric disorder: a more extreme version of premenstrual syndrome.
            -Symptoms: negative moods, anger/irritability, suicidal thoughts, changes in appetite, bloating, muscle/joint pain, and all other symptoms associated with PMS.
    -Perinatal depression: occcurs during pregnancy or after childbirth.
            -Symptoms: extreme sadness, anxiety, unnatural fatigue.
    -Perimenopausal depression: affects women during the menopausal transition.
            -Symptoms: extreme feelings of irritability, anxiety, sadness, or 
Bipolar:
 - Bipolar disorder causes unusual shifts in a person's mood, energy, activity levels and concentration, and can make it difficult to complete every day tasks. There are three types of bipolar disorder. Generally, all three types involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. Moods go from being energized, to being sad, in small periods of time. 
 - Changing hormones during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause can affect how severe a woman's bipolar disorder is, but menstrual cycle conditions (like premenstrual syndrome) are not the same as bipolar disorder. Women and men are equally likely to have bipolar I disorder, but women are more likely to have bipolar II disorder and may experience more rapid cycling between highs and lows. Women with bipolar disorder are also more likely than men with bipolar disorder to have other physical and mental health conditions, including problems with alcohol use, depression caused by bipolar disorder, thyroid disease, obesity caused by medicines that treat bipolar disorder, and migraine headaches.
    - Bipolar 1 disorder is manic episodes that last for at least 7 days or by symptoms that are so severe that the person needs medical care. Depressive episodes can occur here as well. Experiencing four or more episodes of mania or depression within 1 year is called “rapid cycling.”
